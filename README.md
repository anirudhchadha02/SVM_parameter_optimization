About SVM and Parameter Optimization

Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

Some of the most important parameters of SVM such as kernel, C, and gamma can be changed in order to achieve a higher accuracy. This is called as Hyperparameter Tuning.

We can perform this task using GridSearchCV for optimizing these parameters.

In this python file, I've used a Fitness Function to optimize the parameters.

# Dataset

The dataset for the project has been downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. 
The dataset was formed so that each session
would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid
any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user
profile, or period. 

Number of Instances: 12330

Number of Attributes: 18
